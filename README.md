## About Application
This application was created for educational purposes and presents the most common security vulnerabilities found in applications based on the Laravel framework. It is based on the OWASP Top 10, a compilation of the most common threats to web applications.

With this application you will learn:
* What are the most common vulnerabilities in Laravel.
* How attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities work.
* How to effectively secure your application against threats.

The project includes both examples of flawed implementations that lead to vulnerabilities and their corrected versions with security best practices applied.
The goal of the application is to raise awareness among developers and promote secure practices in software development.
